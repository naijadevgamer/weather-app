<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## 🌍 Overview

![screenshot](./src/app.png)

Welcome to my Weather Forecast App! This app is all about giving you accurate and up-to-date weather information for your location or any city you search for. Whether you want to check if you need an umbrella today or plan your weekend trip, this app got you covered! 😎

---

### 🛠️ Built With

This application was built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### My Experience

Building this weather app was a really fun experience. I learned a lot about working with APIs, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also enjoyed implementing the MVC architecture, which made my code organized and easy to maintain. I can definitely say I've improved my frontend skills through this project! 💪

One thing I found very interesting was dealing with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live data and displaying it in a user-friendly way. Working with weather data is quite fascinating!

### My Wisdom 🌟

Here's a piece of wisdom from my journey: _"Take things step by step, and don't be afraid to experiment."_ Sometimes the best solutions come from trying out different ideas and approaches.
